# school-funding-simulation
Simulation of school budgets based on New York's Fair Student Funding formula. 

This study aimed to determine the efficacy of funding structures on schools and to discover potential holes or inefficiencies. 
A Python simulation was created using New Yorkâ€™s Fair Student Funding (FSF) formula as a base. 
The FSF formula designates funds based on categories that students fit under, which include poverty, 
English Language Learner status, special needs, academic intervention, and specialized/advanced classes. 
A random percentage of the simulated school population was designated to each category and a budget was created.
